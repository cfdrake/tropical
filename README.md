Ramon Sender - "Tropical Fish Opera" for Monome Norns.

> The most unconventional composers in the Bay Area at the time, presented on a series usually host to more conventional classical music. Imagine a fish aquarium with staff lines drawn on it. Now play the fish as they move up and down the scale in the bowl. You have the concept of this infamous work that, for a short time, became the talk of the town here in San Francisco.
